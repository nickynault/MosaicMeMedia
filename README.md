# MosaicMeMedia
MosaicMeMedia is a creative app that allows you to upload a zipped folder filled with images and have them be made into a customizable mosaic for you!
Simply clone the repo and run the app. Enjoy!


The initial idea for this was to use a common social media platform's API to pull your public account's images. Sadly, most APIs require a bit more work to get access to. Maybe coming soon.
